# SpotifySongMatcher

My goal with this project is to be able to take an input of a song name and artist, search [musicstax.com](https://musicstax.com/) to find that specific track, find similar tracks using the websites features, and put the similar tracks into a Spotify playlist with the original track as well.

The idea for this project came from my love of music. I am always exploring new genres and trying to find new artists to listen to, but Spotify's built in features that help find new songs weren't able to help me.

Eventually it would be nice to create a webpage for this project, but that I am mostly doing this as a personal project and using it as an opportunity to learn python.
